# github-workflow assignment

## DUE: 17 Jan 2017

## Instructions:
***NOTE:***This assignment has a dual purpose. 1. To test the Git workflow procedures for completing assignments this semester and 2. To ensure you have Android Studio installed correctly.

### TODO:
1. Install Android Studio for your OS. If you have issues, please post questions on Slack.
2. Create a simple "Hello World" Android application.
3. Using the Android Virtual Device, create a virtual device.
4. Start the virtual device and run the Application.
4. VCS -> Import into Version Control -> Share Project on GitHub. Use 'Initial Commit' as commit message.
5. Verify files were uploaded to your GitHub account.
 
 ***Note:*** Any issues you have with either the GitHub steps or Java questions should be asked publically in Slack. If you have a question, chances are someone else does also. If you see someone has posted a question on Slack and you know the answer, please chime in and answer. This might seem rough at the beginning, but I promise it will get easier.
 
 ## Challenge: Create an SSH key and set up Github to use it (SSH rather than HTTPS). ##
 This will remove you having to enter your username/password for every push.
